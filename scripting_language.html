Cbus Scripting Language (SCT)

A script file contains:
•	Import statements to load other scripts
•	Comments
•	Macro definitions
•	Receive action definitions

A macro is run when requested by the user from the graphical user interface.
A receive action is run when the filter of the receive matches an event seen on the Cbus.

A macro is defined using the “macro” keyword, the name of the macro and a block of statements to run:

macro(“macro name”) {
     Block of statements
}

A receive action is defined using the “receive” keyword, a regular expression against which to match received events and a block of statements to run:

receive(“regular expression filter”) {
     Block of statements
}

Literals
A string literal is written between double quote characters. E.g. “a string literal”.
A decimal integer literal is written as a number with no leading zeros. E.g. 10 
A hexadecimal integer is written with a leading 0x followed by 0-9 and A-F characters. E.g. 0xFFFF

Statements
The following statements are supported:
•	Variable assignment
varname = expression;
•	Transmit
tx(message_string_expression);
•	TransmitReceive
txrx(message_string_expression) receive(filter_string_expression) { block to be executed when a cbus event matching the filter is received} timeout(integer_expression in milliseconds) {block to be executed if no matching event is received before the timeout is reached}
•	If 
if (condition_boolean_expression) {block to be executed if the expression is true}
•	ifelse
if (condition_boolean_expression) {block to be executed if the expression is true} else {block executed if the condition is false}
•	Pause
pause (delay_integer_expression);
•	Execute
execute (commad_string_expression);
•	Prompt
prompt type message_string_expression;

A prompt type may be one of:
ok        Just an “OK” button is shown
yesno      “Yes” and “No” buttons are shown. The prompt statement returns either “yes” or “no” depending upon which button was pressed.
string     A text entry area and an OK button is shown. The prompt statement returns the text the user entered.
integer    A text entry area and an OK button is shown. The prompt statement returns the integer the user entered.

Operators
String, Boolean and Integer equality: ==, !=, 
Integer comparison: >, >=, <, <=
String concatenation: +
Integer arithmetic: +. -, *, /, ++, --, >>, <<, >>>
Parentheses: ()
Bit operators: |, &
Unary: -, !, ~
Logical: &&, ||

Type Conversion
Automatic type conversion is done where possible. E.g. 2 * ”3” would give the result 6
“2” + “3” gives the result “23”
2 + 3 gives the result 5
“2” + 3 gives the result “23”

Single character string : char(integer)
2 character hexadecimal string : hex1(integer)
4 character hexadecimal string : hex2(integer)

Variables
Variables may be defined using the assignment statement. Variables may be used by putting their name into an expressions:
number = 7;
prompt ok “Number = ”+number;

Within a receive block the variable “this” is set to be the cbus event which matched the filter, triggering the receive block.

Cbus events
Cbus events have the format:
“:ShhhhNood1d2d3d4d5d6d7;”
Where 
•	:, S, N and ; are this explicit characters.
•	h is a hexadecimal number forming the SIDH and SIDL of the CAN header.
•	o is a hexadecimal number forming the OPC
•	d1 to d7 are hexadecimal numbers forming the event data. These are optional.

The event data may be extracted from a message using the [] operator. For example
message[1] would extract the first data byte from message as an integer.
message[1]<<8|message[2] obtains the first two data bytes as a 16bit integer. This is useful to extract the Node Number from a message. 
The OPC integer can be obtained using message[opc].

Filters
A receive or a txrx filter is a regular expression string which is used to match against a Cbus event. A typical filter would be:
“:S….N50.*” to match any OPC=50 i.e. RQNN command

Comments
// introduces a comment which extends until the end of the line
/* introduces a comment which extends until a */ sequence is found

Examples
macro(“Turn ON”) {
     tx(“:S0B20N9011112222;”);
}
macro(“Turn OFF”) {
     tx(“:S0B20N9111112222;”);
}
Receive(“:S….N50.*”) {          // RQNN
     nn = prompt integer “Enter a node number”);
     tx(“:S0B20N42”+hex2(nn));  // SNN
}
